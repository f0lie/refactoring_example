# Refactoring Example
Refactor a simple program in Python.

I made a presentation on how to refactor code. These are the files refered in the presentation.

If you want to use main_4.py or display.py, you need to use blessed.

`pip install blessed`

## Todo

    1. Add the blessed version to the presentation.
