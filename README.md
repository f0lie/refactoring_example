# Refactoring Example
Refactor a simple program in Python.

I made a presentation on how to refactor code. These are the files refered in the presentation.

It depends on namedlist so if you want to use it do
`pip install namedlist`

## Todo

    1. Need to add slides on OOP

    2. Add gifs of actual code running

    3. Change code and show differences between two versions
